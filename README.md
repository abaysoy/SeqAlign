This Function will allow you to optimally align proteomic sequences. 

You can run this from terminal usin: 
Rscript --vanilla hw1.R input.txt blosum62.txt

Input files needed are: 
1. inputFile  = two sequences that are intended to be aligned
2. scoreFile = blossum-like matrix or other matrix that is referenceable by the algorithmfor aligning the sequences.
3. open gap penalty
4. extension gap penalty = for affine penatly
